# Day 01 - Introduction to devops and Cloud

# 1 What is your understanding of Devops and Cloud Engineering?
-> Devops
- Devops is not just a tools it is a culture that connects Devlopment and Operations teams to Deliver software faster, Automate processe improve        reliability and reduce manual errors Devops is about building, testing,deploying, and maintaining maintaining software efficiently like infinity (∞)

-> Cloud Engineering
- Cloud Engineering is about Designing, building, and managing infrastructure on cloud platforms like 
 Instead of buying:
- Physical servers
- Hard drives
- Network cables
  
We use cloud platforms like:
- AWS
- Azure
- GCP

Real-Life Example
Old Way (Traditional IT):Company buys physical servers Keeps them in office Maintains hardware manually

Cloud Way: Company rents servers online Can increase or decrease anytime Pays only for what they use That is Cloud Engineering.

# 2 Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
- I want to build my career in DevOps and Cloud because I am very interested in automation and modern infrastructure. I am curious about how systems are automated and how the continuous DevOps lifecycle works from development to deployment.

# 3 Where do you want to reach?
- My mission is to master the core DevOps tools and practices so that I can design and manage automated CI/CD pipelines. My aim is to become a successful DevOps Engineer who can bridge the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

# 4 How you will stay consistent every single day?
- My Promise to Myself Today"
I will stay consistent by remembering this:  
- I am learning the philosophy of automation, efficiency, and reliability—but I will master it through 1% daily progress, not perfection. It's okay     if I don't understand everything today. I just need to be better than I was yesterday.
- This is how I build my DevOps career—one consistent day at a time.
